# Introduction

Welcome to the Llama docs! Here you will learn everything you will need to know to use llama effectively.

## What is Llama?
 
Llama is a governance system for onchain organizations. Llama enables organizations to encode access control policies, create rules to execute actions, manage shared accounts, and much more.

## Why Llama?

Existing governance solutions were a huge leap forward in onchain governance, but with time have proven to be cumbersome, inefficient, and ill suited for many onchain organizations today.
Llama has pulled from our experiences contributing to protocol DAOs for the last two years to build the governance framework we would like to see in order to solve many of the problems plaguing onchain governance today.
