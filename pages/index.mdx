# Introduction

Welcome to the Llama docs! Here, you will learn everything you need to effectively use Llama.

## What is Llama?

Llama is an onchain governance system. Llama enables onchain organizations to encode access control policies, create rules to execute actions, manage shared accounts, and much more.

## Why Llama?

While existing governance solutions were a leap forward for onchain organizations, over time they have proven to be cumbersome, inefficient, and ill-suited for many onchain organizations today. We have contributed to protocols and onchain communities over the past two years and have experienced these problems first-hand. Llama is built with those learnings in mind â€” it is the framework we wish we had.
