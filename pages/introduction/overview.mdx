# Introduction

Welcome to the Llama docs! Here, you will learn everything you need to effectively use Llama.

## What is Llama?

Llama is an onchain governance framework for protocols. It enables protocols to encode access control policies, create and execute actions, and manage funds programmatically.

## Why Llama?

We have contributed to protocols over the past two years and have experienced first-hand how bad governance design can lead to inefficient decision making, cumbersome processes, and lack of effective decentralization. Llama is built with those learnings in mind â€” it is the framework we wish we had. Llama helps protocols run their operations with 10 members or 10,000. Through Llama, functions can be permissioned granularly and access control policies can be issued to individuals, multisigs, or token voting DAO contracts.
