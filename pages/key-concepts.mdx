# Key Concepts

- **Instance**: A standalone onchain governance and access control system. Llama instances can be used to govern a protocol or any other smart contract system.
- **Policies**: Non-transferable NFTs that are used by an instance to define its participants' roles and permissions.
  - **Roles**: A signifier given to one or more policyholders. Roles can have zero or more permission IDs.
  - **Permission IDs**: A hash of a target contract, function selector, and strategy contract that represent the right to create an action. Actions cannot be created unless a policyholder holds a role with the correct permission ID.
- **Actions**: Proposed, executable transactions that can be initiated by policyholders.
- **Strategies**: Contracts that set the rules for how an action goes from creation to execution.
- **Executor**: The single exit point of a Llama instance. The executor address will be the `msg.sender` for any executed actions.
- **Accounts**: Contracts deployed directly by Llama instances to manage onchain assets.
